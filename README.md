My GitHub account serves as a portfolio of my coding projects and contributions, focusing on cybersecurity and open source collaboration. As an IT Cybersecurity student, I use this platform to share my work, learn from the community, and enhance my skills in secure software development.

This repository hosts my IT cybersecurity projects, focusing on network security and ethical hacking techniques. It includes Python scripts for vulnerability scanning and a series of Jupyter notebooks documenting my research on secure coding practices. This project reflects my journey in understanding cybersecurity threats and developing preventive measures.

I initiated the process by navigating to my GitHub repository online and copying the repository's URL. Then, I opened GitHub Desktop, selected 'File' > 'Clone repository' from the menu, and pasted the URL in the 'URL' tab. After choosing a suitable local path for the repository, I clicked 'Clone' to download all the files to my local machine. This allowed me to work on the project offline and synchronize my changes with GitHub later.
